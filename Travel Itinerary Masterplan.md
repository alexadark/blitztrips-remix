# Travel Itinerary App Masterplan

## App Overview and Objectives

The Travel Itinerary App is designed to automate the creation of comprehensive travel itineraries for travel bloggers. The primary objective is to significantly reduce the time bloggers spend on manual itinerary creation (from 5-8 hours to approximately 1 hour) while maintaining high-quality, personalized travel plans.

Key objectives:
1. Streamline the itinerary creation process
2. Provide customized travel recommendations based on user input
3. Generate professional, ready-to-use PDF itineraries
4. Improve itinerary suggestions over time using AI and user feedback

## Target Audience

The primary target audience is travel bloggers who create custom itineraries for their clients.

## Core Features and Functionality

1. User Authentication and Dashboard: Secure login and personalized dashboard for managing itineraries
2. User Input Form: Comprehensive form to capture client preferences and requirements
3. Flight Search and Selection: Integration with flight APIs to find and compare flight options
4. Itinerary Generation: AI-powered creation of personalized travel plans
5. Accommodation Suggestions: Integration with booking platforms for lodging recommendations
6. Activity Recommendations: Suggestions for tours, attractions, and experiences
7. Transportation Planning: Recommendations for inter-city travel (trains, buses, car rentals)
8. Restaurant Suggestions: AI-generated dining recommendations (not included in budget calculations)
9. PDF Generation: Creation of professionally formatted, editable itinerary documents
10. Itinerary Editor: Interface for bloggers to review and modify generated itineraries
11. Tagging System: Ability to categorize and easily retrieve past itineraries

## High-level Technical Stack Recommendations

1. Framework: 
   - Nextjs (with Shipfast) for authentication and sales
   - Remix for the main application
2. Styling: TailwindCSS with DaisyUI for rapid UI development
3. AI Integration: Vercel AI SDK with potential integration of Langchain for complex AI tasks
4. Database: MongoDB (via Shipfast) with Prisma as the ORM
5. APIs: 
   - SerpAPI for flight and accommodation searches
   - Amadeus API for activities and car rentals
   - Tavily for additional search capabilities
6. PDF Generation: Investigation needed (Canvas API integration or alternatives like PDFKit)
7. Caching: Redis for improved performance and reduced API calls
8. Error Tracking: Sentry for monitoring and error reporting

## Conceptual Data Model

1. User (handled by Shipfast/MongoDB)
   - ID
   - Name
   - Email
   - Password (hashed)

2. Client
   - ID
   - UserID (foreign key)
   - Name
   - Preferences

3. Itinerary
   - ID
   - UserID (foreign key)
   - ClientID (foreign key)
   - StartDate
   - EndDate
   - Budget
   - Status (draft, finalized)
   - Tags

4. ItineraryDay
   - ID
   - ItineraryID (foreign key)
   - Date
   - Location

5. Activity
   - ID
   - ItineraryDayID (foreign key)
   - Type (flight, accommodation, tour, restaurant, etc.)
   - Details
   - StartTime
   - EndTime
   - Cost

6. Flight
   - ID
   - ItineraryID (foreign key)
   - Airline
   - FlightNumber
   - DepartureCity
   - ArrivalCity
   - DepartureTime
   - ArrivalTime
   - Cost

## User Interface Design Principles

1. Simplicity: Clean, uncluttered interfaces focusing on essential information
2. Progressive Disclosure: Reveal information and options as needed to reduce cognitive load
3. Consistency: Maintain consistent design patterns throughout the app
4. Feedback: Provide clear feedback on user actions and system processes
5. Accessibility: Ensure the app is usable by people with various abilities
6. Responsive Design: Optimize for various screen sizes and devices
7. Dashboard-centric: Design a comprehensive dashboard for users to manage their itineraries and access key features efficiently

## Security Considerations

1. User Authentication: Implement secure login and password hashing (handled by Shipfast)
2. Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
3. API Security: Use API keys and rate limiting to protect external service integrations
4. Input Validation: Implement thorough server-side validation to prevent injection attacks
5. Regular Security Audits: Conduct periodic security reviews and updates
6. Compliance: Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR)
